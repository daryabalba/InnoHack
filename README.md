The recent data digitization created the necessity for linking individuals from one misformatted source to another. We evaluate an automated methods for record linkage using machine learning techniques.

Navigation through repository:
1. ``docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`` - contains scripts for database initialization
1. ``scripts/`` - contains the source code for the project (main.py)
    -  ``toolkit/`` - contains utility functions (tool_functions.py)
3. ``dockerfile`` - a set of instructions used for building a custom docker image
4. ``docker-compose.yaml`` - script used to run multiple docker containers
